# claudart — plan

> **Agents:** this file is the source of truth for deep context (FSA proofs, sensitivity internals, full pipeline architecture, deferred Phase 5 design subagent spec). Read before editing the public README.

This file is the never-lose-context document for claudart.
README.md = current public API (curated view). CHANGELOG.md = version history. PLAN.md = vision + reasoning + where we are.
docs/design.md = formal session state machine (FSA). docs/session_log.md = design decision record.

---

## Phase 5 — design subagent (deferred)

A specialized agent role for visual design work. The planner would route requests with `category=feature × intent=design` (a new `IntentClass` variant) to a `gui_design_agent`. Planned deliverables:

- `lib/pipeline/agents/gui_design_agent.dart` (new)
- `lib/pipeline/flows/gui_design_flow.dart` (new)
- `lib/pipeline/agents/planner.dart` (extension; `IntentClass.design` variant)
- `lib/logging/planner_log.dart` (new)

**Status:** none of the above exist in code. `IntentClass` currently has only `explore`, `analyze`, `implement`, `document` ([categorization.dart:48](lib/pipeline/agents/categorization.dart#L48)). Public README scrubbed of this section to keep it honest.

**Restart criteria:** when a real design task surfaces that warrants a dedicated agent role, lift this section back into the public roadmap.

---

## Vision

claudart is the **AI agent workflow layer** for software projects — and the **workspace scaffolding
system** that gives every project a consistent, self-describing context structure.

Two complementary tools:
- **claudart** — session orchestration (setup → suggest → save → debug → teardown)
- **zedup** — work management (profiles, branches, dashboard, registry)

claudart works on branches. zedup manages them. They share the same registry.

    K[dartrix detected in pubspec] -->|usesDartrix: true| B
    B -->|coverage-gaps section| C
```

The end state:
```
claudart add     → wizard: configure workspace, generate markdown triple, register in MEMORY.md
claudart setup   → initialize session, write handoff
/suggest         → investigate, write root cause to handoff
/save            → checkpoint + transition to ready-for-debug
/debug           → implement fix, tests must pass before done
claudart teardown → archive handoff, promote to skills
```

---

## Architecture principles

**The session IS a deterministic finite automaton.**
Every command is a transition. Every state is an enum variant. Missing transitions are compile errors,
not runtime surprises. See `docs/design.md` for the formal proof.

**The handoff file is the session.** It survives terminal kills, context limits, and model
switches. The terminal process is ephemeral; the handoff is not. This is why suggest → save →
debug requires the save step — it externalizes state before crossing a session boundary.

**Templates are the source of truth. Documents are rendered views.**
Every markdown file (PLAN.md, CLAUDE.md, README sections, diagrams, changelogs) is
generated from a template. No information lives only in a rendered document — it lives in
the template that generated it. README.md is always derivable; it is never the origin.

**Self-hosting law.** claudart must be able to debug its own bugs using its own workflow.
If a claudart session can't be run with `claudart setup` on the claudart repo, the tool is
broken. Every architecture decision is tested against this law.

**Injectable I/O everywhere.** No hardcoded stdin/stdout in lib/. Every interactive component
has an injected interface so tests can simulate input without a TTY. This is non-negotiable.

---

## Template system

### What templates are

Templates are Dart functions in `lib/templates/` that take explicit named params and
return a markdown string. They are pure — no I/O, no side effects. They can be unit tested
in isolation. They are the source of truth for every document claudart generates.
(Earlier drafts of this doc described a shared `WorkspaceConfig` struct as the input —
that was never built: every template style-matches `handoff_template.dart`'s existing
explicit-param convention instead, so callers only pass what a given document actually
needs, not a facade over every workspace field.)

```
lib/templates/
  plan_template.dart            → PLAN.md for a workspace
  claude_template.dart          → CLAUDE.md (context window) for a workspace
  changelog_template.dart       → CHANGELOG.md structure + entry format
  diagram_template.dart         → Mermaid diagrams (architecture, state machines, dependency graphs)
  readme_template.dart          → README.md Roadmap section (generated, marker-spliced)
  github_log_template.dart      → GitHub issues log section in PLAN.md
  archive_entry_template.dart   → archive/ delta-record entries (frontmatter + removed content)
```

### AddAnswers — the wizard's answer set

Collected once by the `claudart add` wizard (`lib/commands/add.dart`), then fed to every
template. A record typedef, not a class — matches this codebase's preference for records
over classes for simple shape-only data (also: the name `WorkspaceConfig` was already taken,
by an unrelated class — `lib/workspace/workspace_config.dart`, loaded from `workspace.json`,
covering owner/project/session metadata, not wizard answers):

```dart
typedef AddAnswers = ({
  String projectName,
  String? dartSdkConstraint,
  bool usesDartrix,       // → injects coverage-gaps section into PLAN.md
  bool githubTracking,    // → injects issues log + planned table into PLAN.md + README
  bool mermaidDiagrams,   // → injects architecture diagram into PLAN.md
  bool changelogEnabled,  // → generates CHANGELOG.md with version entry format
  ProjectType projectType, // cli, library, tui, flutter — shapes the profile in CLAUDE.md
});
```

`mermaidDiagrams`/`changelogEnabled` are recorded on the answer set but not yet acted on —
`runAdd`'s own file header documents this as deliberately out of scope for Phase 3.

### Feature lifecycle — from idea to public README

Every feature follows the same lifecycle through templates:

```
1. PLAN.md section   ← "what's next" entry + Mermaid diagram (if mermaidDiagrams: true)
2. GitHub issue      ← if githubTracking: true, PLAN.md links to issue number
3. Implementation    ← code
4. CHANGELOG entry   ← version-tagged, links back to issue
5. README section    ← curated public description, derived from PLAN + CHANGELOG context
```

No information exists only in README. README is always the last stop, never the origin.
This means migrating README.md to a new format never loses anything — the source is always
in PLAN.md or the template that generated the README section.

### Diagram templates

Every feature that has a state machine, dependency graph, or data flow gets a Mermaid diagram.
Diagrams live in PLAN.md next to the feature they describe — not in a separate diagrams/ folder.
When a feature moves from "what's next" to "what's built", the diagram moves with it.

```
State machines    → stateDiagram-v2  (session DFA, feature flows)
Dependency graphs → graph LR         (package relationships, module deps)
Data flows        → sequenceDiagram  (claudart add wizard, suggest → debug flow)
Architecture      → graph TD         (workspace layout, tool relationships)
```

GitHub renders Mermaid as interactive SVG. The diagram in PLAN.md IS the diagram in the
GitHub view — no separate tooling needed.

### GitHub tracking section (optional, config-driven)

When `githubTracking: true`, PLAN.md gets a "GitHub issues" section that maps planned work
to issue numbers. README.md gets a "Planned" table that links to those issues. The
CHANGELOG.md format includes `(#N)` references on every entry.

This section is generated once and then maintained by hand — it's a living log, not
re-generated on every `claudart add` run.

---

## Workspace scaffold — `claudart add` wizard

When `claudart add` runs in a project directory, it:

1. **Reads git config** — author name + email pre-filled
2. **Asks configuration questions** — one at a time, minimal, confirmable:
   ```
   Project name: [detected from git]
   Dart SDK: >=3.5.0 <5.0.0
   Uses dartrix? [y/n]
   GitHub issue tracking? [y/n]
   Mermaid diagrams in PLAN.md? [y/n]
   CHANGELOG.md? [y/n]
   Project type? [cli / library / tui / flutter]
   ```
3. **Generates the markdown triple** from templates into `~/.claudart/<project>/`:
   ```
   PLAN.md    ← vision stub + configured sections
   CLAUDE.md  ← pre-wired context window (profile + "read PLAN.md first" + constraints)
   ```
4. **Registers in MEMORY.md** — writes workspace pointer to Claude Code's auto-memory
   at `~/.claude/projects/<hash>/memory/` so Claude immediately knows this project exists
5. **Links the workspace** — `.claude/` symlink into project root

The generated CLAUDE.md has `read PLAN.md first` hardcoded to the workspace path.
The generated PLAN.md has the configured sections already present as stubs.
The developer fills in the stubs — claudart provides the structure.

### What re-running `claudart add` does

Re-running is safe. It regenerates only the environment sections of CLAUDE.md (SDK constraints,
paths, git rules). It never overwrites content the developer has written into PLAN.md stubs.
The profile section of CLAUDE.md is preserved — it is not re-generated.

---

## Relationship to zedup and dartrix

**dartrix:** claudart detects dartrix in `pubspec.yaml` and injects a coverage-gaps section into
the generated PLAN.md. The section explains: "enum variants that haven't been exercised in
each feature appear here as named failures from `matrix.gaps()`." claudart doesn't run the
matrix — it just gives PLAN.md the right structure to track it.

**claudart's matrix vs dartrix's matrix — distinct, not overlapping:**
claudart models enum × getter (correctness: does each variant return the right mapped value?).
dartrix models enum × feature (participation: is each variant exercised in each feature?).
Same compile-time philosophy, different dimensions. No delegation needed at current scope.
Future: `testSelector()` could replace claudart's manual 24-cell enum assertions when
claudart's test volume grows — requires adding dartrix as a dep and restructuring around
`AppType`/`FeatureType`. Deliberate decision to defer; log here when ready to act.

**zedup:** claudart reads `zedup.md` as a memory artifact — the formal enum taxonomy for zedup's
domain. When claudart sessions target zedup or dartrix, the handoff should include the relevant
enum context so Claude understands the typed model without re-reading source files each time.

**Same command names, different meaning — not a bug, just read carefully:**
`link` and `setup` exist as commands on both binaries, meaning different things on each.
`claudart link` registers a project with claudart's own registry (`~/.claudart/registry.json`);
`zedup link` binds a cwd to a zedup workspace under `~/.config/<profile>/zedup/workspaces/` —
a separate registry entirely. `claudart setup` starts a debug session and writes `handoff.md`;
`zedup setup`/`zedup init`/`zedup config` are zedup's own onboarding/UX-preference wizard,
unrelated to claudart sessions. Never ambiguous at the CLI (`claudart`/`zedup` disambiguate
before the subcommand matters) — noted here only so a human or agent cross-referencing both
repos' docs doesn't conflate them.

**Delegation of integrity:**

| Concern | Owner | Mechanism |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Dart test coverage enforcement | dartrix | Compile-time exhaustive switch — new enum variant without `features` update = compile error |
| Session workflow correctness | claudart | DFA state machine — invalid transitions don't compile |
| Workspace context window | claudart (generated) | CLAUDE.md, pre-wired to PLAN.md, generated by `claudart add` |
| Product logic | zedup | Enum-driven TUI, proven patterns promoted to dartrix |
| Public documentation | README.md | Curated view derived from PLAN.md — never the origin |

## What's been built

### v1 — Core workflow (complete)
- `claudart setup` — per-session initialization, handoff.md written
- `/suggest` → `/save` → `/debug` handshake enforced
- `HandoffStatus` enum with exhaustive switches — state machine correct
- `claudart teardown` — archive + skills promotion
- `claudart kill` — emergency reset
- Self-hosting validated — claudart has debugged its own bugs

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    direction LR
    [*] --> suggest_investigating : claudart setup

    suggest_investigating --> suggest_investigating : /save (root cause unknown)
    suggest_investigating --> ready_for_debug       : /save (root cause confirmed)
    suggest_investigating --> suggest_investigating : rotate [build gate ✓]

    ready_for_debug --> debug_in_progress : /debug
    ready_for_debug --> suggest_investigating : rotate [build gate ✓]

    debug_in_progress --> debug_in_progress : /save
    debug_in_progress --> suggest_investigating : rotate [build gate ✓]
    debug_in_progress --> resolved : claudart teardown

    suggest_investigating --> erased : claudart kill
    ready_for_debug --> erased : claudart kill
    debug_in_progress --> erased : claudart kill
    resolved --> [*]
```

### v2 — Registry-based workspace model (complete)
Per-project workspaces, migrated from the single global workspace:

```
~/.claudart/
  registry.json          ← startup reads ONLY this
  dc-flutter/
    config.json          ← loaded after project selected
    handoff.md
    skills.md
    archive/
    knowledge/
    PLAN.md              ← generated by claudart add, owned by project
    CLAUDE.md            ← generated by claudart add, re-generatable
```

**Why:** Current single-workspace model is fragile — string matching on CLAUDE.md, no per-project
isolation, manual `claudart link` required, CLAUDE.md bleeds into project root.

**Key changes (all landed):**
- `paths.dart`: `claudeDir → workspaceFor(projectName)`
- `launch.dart`: Phase 1 registry read, Phase 2 workspace load on selection
- `link.dart`: `.claude` symlink only (no CLAUDE.md symlink), writes .gitignore entries
- `_isLinked`: reads registry + checks symlink (no CLAUDE.md string matching)
- Every session command (`setup`, `save`, `teardown`, `kill`, `rotate`,
  `status`, `launch`) resolves its workspace via `Registry.load(io:
  fileIO)` → `entry.workspacePath` — no legacy global-path assumptions
  remain in any of them (verified 2026-09-22).
- `WorkspaceConfig` (`lib/workspace/workspace_config.dart`) — the
  configuration struct Phase 2 needed — already exists and is consumed by
  `scan.dart`, `flow.dart`, `debug.dart`, `suggest.dart`, `rotate.dart`.

### Backfill — sensitivity mode, skills retrieval, static analysis scanner (complete, predates phase-tracking)
Reconciling PLAN.md against README.md's Roadmap table (2026-09-27) found three
shipped features tracked only in README, never given a PLAN.md entry —
violating this file's own "no information exists only in README" rule
(see Template system → Feature lifecycle, above). Backfilled here, verified
against code and first-commit date, not just copied from README's labels:

- **Sensitivity mode + token map** (`3bcbd91`, 2026-03-16) —
  `lib/sensitivity/token_map.dart`/`abstractor.dart` abstract sensitive
  identifiers before they leave the machine; `lib/commands/scan.dart` and
  `RegistryEntry.sensitivityMode` gate it per project.
- **Skills + cosine retrieval** (`3bcbd91`, 2026-03-16) —
  `lib/similarity/cosine.dart` powers skills.md similarity lookup.
- **Static analysis scanner** (`3bcbd91`, 2026-03-16) — `lib/commands/scan.dart`.

Corresponds to README Roadmap table rows 2–4. Row 1 (CLI + workspace +
scaffold) is v1/v2 above; row 5 (design subagent) is already tracked at
PLAN.md:11.

### Phase 2 — Template system (complete)
Built as 3 dependency-ordered slices, each self-hosted through claudart's
own workflow. **Deviates from this document's own original sketch on
purpose**: the flat `WorkspaceConfig` spec this section used to describe
(`usesDartrix`, `githubTracking`, `projectType`, etc.) never matched the
real, already-shipped nested `WorkspaceConfig`
(`lib/workspace/workspace_config.dart`) — building around an invented
struct for Phase 3's not-yet-built wizard would have been premature.
Every template instead takes explicit named params, matching
`handoff_template.dart`/`knowledge_templates.dart`'s established style.

- `lib/templates/diagram_template.dart` — 4 Mermaid generators (state
  diagram, dependency graph, data flow, architecture graph)
- `lib/templates/github_log_template.dart` — `githubLogSection`, a record
  typedef (`GithubLogEntry`) rather than a class
- `lib/templates/changelog_template.dart` — `changelogEntry`
- `lib/templates/plan_template.dart` — `planStub`, composes the diagram
  and GitHub-log output; every section gated independently, omitted
  entirely (not rendered empty) when its flag/param is off
- `lib/templates/claude_template.dart` — relocated from the orphaned
  `claudeMdTemplate` (zero call sites before this), **now actually wired
  into `link.dart`** — `claudart link` regenerates the machine-owned tail
  of CLAUDE.md (marker-based splice, preserves everything hand-maintained
  above `## Generated by claudart link`), fulfilling that heading's own
  claim for the first time. Generic knowledge file references are read
  from disk (`FileIO.listFiles`), not assumed, so a workspace that never
  ran `claudart init` gets no dangling references.

Verified live against this repo's own CLAUDE.md before shipping — found
and fixed real drift between the template and this file's own hand-grown
content (see `docs/session_log.md`'s 2026-09-26 entry for the full story).

### Phase 3 — `claudart add` wizard (complete)
Scaffolds a brand-new project workspace end to end. `lib/commands/add.dart`:
- Pre-fills git author (`readGitAuthor`, new in `lib/git_utils.dart`),
  project name, Dart SDK constraint and dartrix usage (plain regex reads
  of `pubspec.yaml`, no yaml package dependency)
- Injectable questionnaire (SDK constraint, uses dartrix?, GitHub
  tracking?, Mermaid diagrams?, CHANGELOG.md?, project type)
- Generates PLAN.md (`planStub`) and CLAUDE.md (`claudeTemplate`) from
  Phase 2's templates, writes a registry entry
- Symlinks `.claude`/`.cursor` via `createProjectLinks` — extracted out
  of `runLink` so `runAdd` reuses the same mechanism without triggering
  `runLink`'s own CLAUDE.md tail-regeneration step, which would clobber
  the constraint content a fresh scaffold writes
- Registers the project in Claude Code's own auto-memory
  (`~/.claude/projects/<hash>/memory/`, hash = `projectRoot` with `/`
  replaced by `-`) so a session started there already knows it exists

Verified live: a real scratch git repo, `claudart add` run against it,
then `claudart setup` against the same scaffolded workspace — confirms
the self-hosting law holds for a project this command created from
nothing, not just in tests.

Deliberately out of scope this phase: CHANGELOG.md file generation,
Mermaid diagram generation (both answers recorded on the wizard's
answer set, not acted on), README.md advertising `add` until it's
shipped and used for a while.

---

### Phase 4 — UX improvements (complete)
- `skills.md` Pending is now a keyed map: `upsertPendingEntry`/
  `removePendingEntry`/`pendingHasBranch` in `lib/session/teardown_utils.dart`
  replace `/save`'s append-only writes, so repeated saves on the same
  branch upsert one entry instead of accumulating duplicates, and a
  resolved-and-archived teardown removes the entry instead of leaving it
  stale forever
- `lib/ui/render.dart` gained `divider()` and `statusBar()`; the
  hand-rolled `───` blocks and status-line formatting in `setup.dart`/
  `teardown.dart`/`status.dart` now go through them
- Teardown's default-prompt hints condensed from a 2-line
  `"Question\n  (press enter to use: X)"` format to one line
  (`"Question [X]"`) via a shared `lib/util/prompt_with_default.dart`,
  also adopted by `setup.dart`
- `claudart resume` (new, `lib/commands/resume.dart`): loads the newest
  archive entry for the registered project, reads its handoff snapshot,
  and pre-fills `runSetup`'s bug/expected/files/entry-point prompts from
  it (`runSetup` gained matching optional `default*` params)

Found and fixed live: `resume`'s first draft passed its own *resolved*
project root to `runSetup` as `projectRootOverride`, which every command
in this codebase treats as "skip live git detection" — silently breaking
branch detection on a real invocation. Fixed by passing resume's own
original nullable override through unchanged; caught via live smoke
testing, then locked in with a regression test.

### Phase 6 — Agent flow registry + planner.dart (closed, not built)
Corresponds to README Roadmap table row 6 ("planned"), backfilled
2026-09-27, closed 2026-09-27 after evaluating whether to actually build
the unshipped half.

Agent flow registry: shipped — `lib/pipeline/agent_flow.dart`'s
`AgentFlow` enum is the canonical registry of pipeline variants across
claudart and zedup, per its own header comment.

`planner.dart`: **intentionally not built.** Routing/model-selection
logic today lives split across three independently-justified pieces —
`lib/pipeline/agents/categorization.dart` (the τ classification
taxonomy, plus `routeModel()`/`modelForCategorizeOutput()`, the actual
model-routing function every step's `modelSelector` consults),
`lib/pipeline/route_tag.dart` (the `RouteTag` enum), and
`lib/pipeline/step_route.dart` (the `StepRoute` sealed hierarchy —
`GoTo`/`QuestionBranch`/`FeedBackTo`/`EscalateUser`/`ApprovalGate`/
`Complete` — dispatched by `PipelineExecutor`). `lib/logging/
planner_log.dart` is a passive audit logger, not a planner, and was
never in scope for consolidation.

No shared bug or duplicated logic was found across those three files
that a consolidated `planner.dart` would fix — this would be purely
file-organization renaming with no behavior change, exactly the
premature abstraction "Simplicity first" forbids. One minor 2-site
tag-pattern duplication was observed between call sites but sits below
this project's extraction threshold; noted, not acted on.

**Restart criteria:** revisit only if a third call site appears or real
duplication emerges — not on stylistic preference alone.

### Phase 8 — README Roadmap generation (complete)
Delivered narrower than originally scoped: a marker-splice mechanism for
claudart's own README.md's Roadmap table, not full-document generation of
all three READMEs. Investigating the original scope found generating the
*entire* README from PLAN.md would regress it — sections like Proof,
Token efficiency, Authentication, and the styled architecture diagram
exist only in the hand-curated `9f9b942` rewrite with no PLAN.md source.

- `lib/templates/readme_template.dart` (new) — `readmeTemplate` (explicit
  named params, no config struct, same style as `claudeTemplate`/
  `planStub`) renders the `<!-- claudart:link:roadmap -->`-prefixed
  Roadmap block from a caller-supplied `List<RoadmapRow>`.
- `lib/commands/link.dart` — `claudartRoadmapRows`, a hand-maintained
  list (one entry per README Roadmap row); `runLink` splices it into
  README.md at the marker, stopping before the next `---` separator
  (not the next `## ` heading — the first attempt at this ate the
  separator between Roadmap and Cross-repo, caught via live diffing
  before commit). Opt-in: a README.md without the marker is left
  untouched, unlike CLAUDE.md's always-on splice.
- `test/readme_sync_test.dart` gained a third check: the marker's spliced
  content in README.md must equal `readmeTemplate(...)` fed by
  `roadmap.json` byte-for-byte — catches both a missed `claudart link`
  re-run and a manual edit that bypasses the generator. (Originally
  sourced rows from a hardcoded `claudartRoadmapRows` constant in
  `link.dart`; Phase 9 replaced that with per-project `roadmap.json`
  files — see below.)

**Backfill and renumbering, before implementation started:** reconciling
against README's Roadmap table found 6 of its 7 rows had no PLAN.md
source at all (see the Backfill entry and Phase 6/7 above) — a real,
pre-existing violation of this file's own "no information exists only
in README" rule. Fixed first, since generating from an incomplete
PLAN.md would have silently dropped real roadmap history. This is also
why the phase number moved twice (Phase 5 → 6 → 8) before landing —
each number collided with something already using it.

**Verified live, self-hosting law**: recompiled, ran `claudart link`
against this repo twice in a row — second run produced a byte-identical
README.md (idempotent), `git diff README.md` showed only the Roadmap
block changed, nothing else touched.

Deliberately out of scope: dartrix/zedup README migration (see Phase 9,
below — done as a follow-on); generating any README section besides the
Roadmap table; PLAN.md phase-heading standardization (opened as Phase
10, not decided here).

### Phase 9 — Generalize Roadmap generation + extend to dartrix/zedup (complete)
`link.dart`'s hardcoded `claudartRoadmapRows` only worked for claudart's
own README. Generalizing it needed a real per-project data source, and
the first design tried — `roadmapRows` on `WorkspaceConfig`'s
`WorkspaceProject`, sourced from `workspace.json` — was reverted before
landing: `workspace.json` lives entirely outside every project's git
repo (`git check-ignore` errors "outside repository" trying to even
check it), so it can never be a source a fresh clone or CI could verify
the content-parity test against. That would have silently turned a real
test into a no-op everywhere except a machine that already had
`claudart link` run locally.

Redesigned around a git-committed `roadmap.json` at each project's root
instead:
- `readme_template.dart` gained `RoadmapConfig` (`rows` +
  optional `summaryText`/`footerLine`) and `parseRoadmapConfig`;
  `readmeTemplate` gained matching optional params so a project with
  existing custom copy (dartrix's own summary text and "Deep dive" link
  line) isn't silently overwritten with claudart's generic defaults.
- `link.dart` reads `<projectRoot>/roadmap.json` directly via `FileIO`;
  the hardcoded `claudartRoadmapRows` constant is gone.
- claudart's own migration verified as a pure regression: byte-identical
  README.md before and after moving its 8 rows into `roadmap.json`.

**A second real bug, caught live against dartrix**: the marker regex
used `\z` for "end of input" — Dart/JS regex has no `\z` metacharacter
(Perl/Python syntax only); in ECMAScript-flavored regex it's silently a
literal lowercase `z`. Worked by luck against claudart's own roadmap
text (no lowercase `z` in it), corrupted dartrix's README on the very
first live run — its existing content contains "zedup-side," so the
match stopped there instead of at the real `\n---` boundary, leaving
duplicated leftover fragments. Restored from a pre-run backup, fixed to
the correct `(?![\s\S])` idiom, red-before-fix verified with a new
regression test, then re-verified live (idempotent, `git diff` showing
only the intended change). Also de-duplicated the regex itself — it was
copy-pasted into both `link.dart` and its test — by exporting it as
`roadmapMarker`.

**zedup** had no `## Roadmap` section at all. Per explicit decision,
created one from scratch, sourced from zedup's own `PLAN.md` (Phase 1–5
core binary, 5b nocterm dashboard, 5c claudart chat integration —
shipped; branch screen matrix wiring and the v2 GitHub-state matrix +
DartrixSelector pipeline — planned), placed before `## Cross-repo`
matching claudart/dartrix's layout.

Verified live across all three repos: claudart (regression, byte-
identical), dartrix (retrofit, only the marker line added), zedup (new
section, only that section added) — each idempotent on a second run,
each `git diff` touching nothing outside its own Roadmap block.
zedup's own pre-existing, unrelated in-progress work (chat/dashboard
files already modified in its working tree before this session) was
left untouched.

### Phase 7 — Per-step thinking/cost metadata + routing loop-back signal (complete, partial scope)
Corresponds to README Roadmap table row 7. Delivered narrower than the
row's "TUI dependency graph" label suggests — a full node-and-edge graph
layout doesn't fit the pane's fixed 36-char width (verified against
`agents_workflow_pane.dart`'s own header comment); the honest version
built instead:

- **claudart**: `AgentStarted` gained `isRevisit` — `PipelineExecutor`
  tracks a `Set<String> visited` across its routing loop and sets it
  whenever a step (`GoTo`/`QuestionBranch`/`FeedBackTo`/`EscalateUser`/
  `ApprovalGate`-refine) runs again, uniformly across all route types
  since they funnel through the same loop. This is the graph-*cycle*
  signal a subscriber needs — previously the event stream carried no
  way to tell a loop-back from ordinary forward advance.
- **zedup**: `AgentSlot` now forwards `numTurns` and `isRevisit` from
  events that already carried them but were silently dropped at the
  handler layer (`AgentCompleted`'s `thinking`/`stopReason`/`durationMs`/
  `numTurns` existed since `56cf9ab`, 2026-09-21 — only `usage` was ever
  read). The pane renders a revisited step with a loop glyph (`↻`)
  instead of its sequence number, and appends a compact thinking-token
  count to the cost badge when present.

**Not built, deliberately**: a literal connector-line graph layout
between rows, and a new `durationMs` field (zedup's existing wall-clock
`elapsedMs` already approximates it). Both would need more pane-layout
rework than this pass's scope justified.

**Two real mistakes caught before commit, not by any test**: while
writing the `isRevisit` regression test, first tried distinguishing two
test steps' runner calls by comparing `AgentModel` and found both used
the same model — instead of giving them distinct models (the fix),
swapped the comparison to a bare string literal, introducing exactly the
`bare_string_for_enum`-class violation this project forbids. Caught and
fixed properly. Separately, a blanket `dart format` run reformatted
~330 unrelated lines because the installed SDK's formatter doesn't
reproduce this codebase's hand-aligned style (same drift as the earlier
`workspace_config.dart` incident) — reverted and reapplied by hand,
final diff 92 lines across 3 files.

## What's next

### Phase 10 — PLAN.md phase-heading standardization
Opened, not started. Phase 8 found PLAN.md's phase headers use three
different shapes for marking status (inline in the heading, a separate
`**Status:**` line, or both) and chose a hand-maintained row list over
parsing them (see Phase 8's "deliberately out of scope"). If a future
need justifies automating `roadmap.json` generation, standardize
every phase heading to one format first — e.g. always
`### Phase N — Title (status)` — then a small regex extractor becomes
safe to write. Restart criteria: only if hand-maintaining the row list
becomes a real, recurring pain point; the marker-splice mechanism itself
does not require this.

## GitHub archive convention

Every repo using claudart's template system gets an `archive/` folder in the repo root,
committed to main. It is a **delta record only** — it contains exclusively content that has
been removed from main documents. It never duplicates anything currently in main.

### The delta rule

> If the content still exists anywhere in any current document on main, it does not belong
> in archive. Archive only holds what main dropped.

This is enforceable by inspection: if you can find the content by grepping main, the archive
entry is wrong.

### Archive entry format

Each entry is a single markdown file. The frontmatter declares the delta explicitly:

```markdown
---
archived: YYYY-MM-DD
source: <file> § <section heading>
superseded_by: <what replaced it, or "shipped" if the feature completed>
---

[exact content that was removed — nothing added, nothing paraphrased]
```

If `superseded_by` cannot be filled in, the content is not ready to be archived — it still
belongs in main.

### What gets archived

| Content type | Archive when |
|---|---|
| PLAN.md "what's next" section | Feature shipped → moves to "what's built" → old entry archived |
| PLAN.md design decision | Decision reversed → new decision added → original reasoning archived |
| README section | Section removed or consolidated → exact removed text archived |
| CHANGELOG entry | Entry reformatted/consolidated → original wording archived |
| Deprecated experiment | Superseded by a confirmed design → experiment archived |

### What does NOT get archived

- Content that still exists in main (in any form)
- Git history (that's what `git log` is for)
- Handoff/session snapshots (those go in `~/.claudart/<project>/archive/`, not GitHub)
- Speculative ideas that were never in a document (they were never in main to begin with)

### Template support

`lib/templates/archive_entry_template.dart` generates the frontmatter + wraps the removed
content. `claudart add` creates the `archive/` directory (empty, with a `.gitkeep` and a
`README.md` stub explaining the delta rule) as part of workspace scaffold.

When `claudart teardown` or a future `claudart archive` command runs, it can assist in
generating archive entries from removed content — but never automatically. The developer
confirms what's being archived and what superseded it.

    A[Content in main PLAN.md] -->|feature ships| B[moves to What's been built]

## Key decisions log

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Session state is a DFA | Exhaustive enum switch = compile-time transition enforcement; missing cases don't compile |
| save is required between suggest and debug | Externalizes state before crossing session boundary; ensures handoff is the truth |
| handoff.md is the session, not the process | Terminal process is ephemeral; handoff survives kills, context limits, model switches |
| Injectable I/O everywhere in lib/ | No hardcoded stdin/stdout — interactive components must be testable without a TTY |
| Self-hosting law | If claudart can't debug its own bugs with its own workflow, the tool is broken |
| Per-project workspaces (v2) | Single global workspace had string-matching fragility and no project isolation |
| Templates are source of truth | No information lives only in a rendered document; README is always derivable, never the origin |
| Diagrams live in PLAN.md, not a diagrams/ folder | Diagram travels with the feature it describes; GitHub renders Mermaid as SVG |
| claudart add wizard drives generation | Config questions → WorkspaceConfig → templates → markdown triple; DRY across all projects |
| MEMORY.md auto-registration on add | Claude immediately knows the workspace exists; no manual MEMORY.md editing per project |
| dartrix is a pure Dart package, not a markdown generator | claudart generates the dartrix-aware sections; dartrix's responsibility is compile-time coverage |
| README is the last stop | Public README is curated from PLAN.md content — migrating it never loses integral concepts |
| Archive is delta-only | Archive contains only what main dropped — never duplicates current content; enforceable by grep |
| Archive entry requires superseded_by | If you can't name what replaced it, it's not ready to archive — it still belongs in main |
| Session archive ≠ GitHub archive | ~/.claudart/<project>/archive/ holds handoff snapshots; repo archive/ holds document deltas — distinct concerns |
