// confirmation.dart — typed protocol for user confirmation gates
//
// Any skill step that must stop and confirm with the user before acting
// (e.g. /save's Step 2, /debug's pre-implementation check) uses this
// shared wire format instead of each consumer inventing its own free-text
// "did the user say yes" heuristic. One enum, one tag, one parser —
// claudart, zedup, and any future consumer classify the user's reply
// identically.
//
// Structural note: consumers that dispatch stateless per-call requests
// (no conversation history passed to the model — see claudart_runner.dart)
// MUST re-inject the pending question/handoff context into the follow-up
// call. This module only defines the wire format and parses it; it has
// no opinion on how a caller preserves context across calls.
