// pipeline_event.dart — typed events emitted by PipelineExecutor
//
// PipelineExecutor implements a stream-based FSM:
//
//   S = {idle, running, escalating, awaitingApproval, complete, failed}
//   C = PipelineEvent subclasses (one per lifecycle transition)
//   δ : S × C → S  — total function, exhaustive switch, self-loop on invalid
//
//   δ(idle,              AgentStarted)     = running
//   δ(running,           AgentCompleted)   = idle          // advance or complete
//   δ(running,           AgentFailed)      = failed
//   δ(running,           AgentEscalating)  = escalating
//   δ(escalating,        AgentResumed)     = running
//   δ(running,           PlanDraft)        = drafting       // flow command only
//   δ(drafting,          AwaitingApproval) = awaitingApproval
//   δ(awaitingApproval,  AgentStarted)     = running        // after user approves
//   δ(*,                 PipelineCompleted) = complete
//
// Invariant: active ∩ {complete, failed} = ∅
// Invariant: PipelineCompleted is always the final event — never re-emitted.
//
// Subscribers:
//   CLI (runFuture) — renders spinners and prompts based on events.
//   zedup UI       — renders Agents Workflow side pane from the same stream.
